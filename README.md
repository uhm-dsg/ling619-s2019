# LING 619: Practical Exercises in Data Science for Linguistic Research (Spring 2019)


## Basics
* **Instructor:** Bradley McDonnell (mcdonn@hawaii.edu)
* **Time:** Tuesday 9-10am (meets twice a month)
* **Location:** Phonetics Lab (Moore 162) 

## Description
This course is designed to equip students working with a broad range of linguistic data to use cutting edge research methodologies in data science. It will be held in conjunction with the [Data Science Group](https://github.com/uhm-dsg) at the [University of Hawai‘i at Mānoa](https://manoa.hawaii.edu/), which is currently run by the [Department of Linguistics](http://ling.hawaii.edu/). Students enrolled in the course will be expected to participate in the Data Science Group meetings below.  

## Software
Please follow the [**Sotware installation guide**](installation.md) to install all necessary software. **Please install all software before our first meeting.** (Note that we won't begin using **R** or **R Studio** until meeting 4.) 

## Schedule
Below is a tentative course schedule.

## Resources
This course will draw on two valuable resources: 

1. [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham
2. Lessons from [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/)

## Course requirements
Students are required to participate in the 8 meetings listed above and will be asked to be a facilitator for at least one of these meetings. In addition, students are required to *either* participate in 4 LAE lab workshops throughout the semester *or* demonstrate equivilent  progress on a project that relates to this course. Students are also required to complete a final project.

### Final project
Students in the course will be required to create a GitHub repository that contains: 

1. **README.md** file that explains the content of the repository 
1. **RStudio** project with... 
    * **Dataset** (saved as a .csv file)
    * **Code** that transforms the data with tidyverse
    * **Plots** that display the data in a meaningfull way with ggplot.
