# Connecting Rstudio and GitHub
We will connect RStudio and GitHub using an SSH key, so that you do not have enter your username and password every time you sign in to your account. We will follow instructions from the book [Happy Git and GitHub for the useR
](http://happygitwithr.com/). We'll specifically look at sections [12.3.1](http://happygitwithr.com/ssh-keys.html#option-1-set-up-from-rstudio), [12.4.1](http://happygitwithr.com/ssh-keys.html#option-1-set-up-from-rstudio), [12.5.3](http://happygitwithr.com/ssh-keys.html#on-github). If we run into issues with your computer, we can look in these sections for answers.

- Click the green button *Create repository* at the bottom of the page.
- Under the *Quick setup* heading, copy the URL of your repo. You'll need it for the next steps in RStudio.
